# Change Log

## Version 2.0.5 - 2017-02-01
- Fix: Error while parsing the browscap data that occurred in dependence of the source file length, e.g. with the Browscap full ini file in version 6021 (issue #34).
- Feature: Updated composer.json to allow usage with PHP 7.1.x

## Version 2.0.4 - 2016-08-04
- Feature: Added support for older SQLite versions as used by some Linux distributions like CentOS and RHEL (issue #25).

## Version 2.0.3 - 2016-08-02
- Feature: Adjustment to avoid warnings in PHP 7.1.x when using the CLI version.
- Fix: Added info about the required SQLite library version to the documentation.

## Version 2.0.2 - 2016-08-02
- Fix: Corrected the check for directory permissions, so that directories don't have to be writable if only used in read-only mode (issue #26).
- Fix: Corrected the parser for the case that the Browscap source file was generated on a Windows system and contains differend line-endings (issue #28).
- Fix: Fixed wrong example in documentation (issue #27).
- Fix: Adjusted some unit tests to no more use deprecated methods (which caused that the test result on Travis was marked as failed for PHP 5.6.x)

## Version 2.0.1 - 2016-04-23
- Fix: Fixed composer requirements (pull request #24).

## Version 2.0.0 - 2016-04-08
- Feature: Complete rewrite. The new structure is much better extensible. Sources, parsers and formatters are completely independent now, so you can replace them with your own version..
- Feature: Downloading source data is now done with GuzzleHttp, which offers many additional options.
- Feature: SQLite is the new (faster) data storage of the default parser (one database file instead of many files).
- Feature: The default Formatter has been adjusted to exactly return the result of the PHP get_browser() function (boolean values differed and where 'true' and 'false' instead of '1' and '')
- Feature: Unit tests added.
- Feature: Property filters to filter the data generated by the parser and/or the data the formatter returns. If set for the parser, this reduces the data size and helps to improve the parser performance.
- Feature: Additional formatters, for example `Optimized`, with typed return values
- Feature: Command-line support added to update/filter the parser data (using Symfony Console)
- Feature: Library requires PHP >= 5.6 now.
