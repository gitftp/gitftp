                                <p>There are cases, where the hair loss is not very severe and an actual transplant is not required. However, the loss is visible and the person who is suffering from the same is looking for a proper solution to the same. This is where medical treatments come into play and truth be told, many a bald heads have actually been covered using these types of medical therapies.</p>
								<p>Mesotherapy is one such medical therapy that is known to have shown positive results in a number of people. In the simplest of terms, Mesotherapy is a process in which growth factors, such as vitamins and proteins are injected directly into the scalp and this leads to proper hair growth. The reason why it is called Mesotherapy is because the medications are injected into the mesoderm, which is the layer right beneath the skin. This mesoderm is the link that connects the tissues of the skin and the layer that contains fat.
								</p>
								<p>
								By injecting the medications into the mesoderm, there is a better chance of the blood getting distributed all over the scalp. In addition, the metabolism of the cells is also enhanced and the revival of hair follicles will also be sped up. This process has actually proven quite helpful to people who are being plagued by active hair loss.</p>
								<p>
								A detailed analysis of your hair loss will be conducted by your doctor, who will also factor in aspects such as your diet, genetic predisposition to hair loss, and hormonal conditions. This will allow the doctor to decide which medicines to combine for Mesotherapy. The perfect concoction will be created just for you and the same will be injected into your scalp, ensuring the best results. The number of sessions required for complete hair regrowth is something that only a qualified doctor can assess. But most of the times, four to six sessions are required to gain the desirable results. 
								</P>
								<p>
								There is a certain amount of maintenance that is required for people who have undergone Mesotherapy. Since there are chemicals in play, they tend to react with toxins, which can be found in the body, should the person not be taking care of themselves. This is why it is important that you ensure that you have a healthy diet, which will allow your body to stay free of toxins. In addition, keeping the body fit is also important because a healthy body will not be home to any toxins.
								</P>
								<p>
