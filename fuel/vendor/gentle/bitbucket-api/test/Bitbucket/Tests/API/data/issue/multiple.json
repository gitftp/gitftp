We just let someone go and we have many repos but didn't use group access rights initially. It will take hours to go through all of them and make sure they no longer have access. Is there a way to remove a user in bulk?\r\n\r\nTo which was replied:\r\n\r\n> Sorry to say this isn't possible. This was the intention of creating group access rights. Going forward, if you have someone in a group, this shouldn't be an issue. Sadly I don't even have a way to do this efficiently.\r\n\r\nTo which I replied: \r\n\r\n> Can I suggest it would be very helpful to add tools that allow us to query repos and see who is on what repo and to bulk move a user from individual repos and add them to a group? If you did that it would make transitioning to groups much easier so more organizations would be able to use them more quickly.\r\n\r\nTo which I was told to add a ticket here. Which I did. :)",
