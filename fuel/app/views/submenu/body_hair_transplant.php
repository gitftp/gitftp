                                <p>Losing hair on the head is a difficult thing to digest for most people, and while a hair transplant would be the easiest way out, sometimes it does not work for certain people. There are certain people who just do not have enough hair in their donor area, to complete a hair transplant procedure. Such a situation can arise due to many reasons, ranging from previous hair transplant procedures to truly severe hair loss.</p>

                                <p>However, just because there is not enough hair on the head, it does not mean that you will not be able to get a proper hair transplant. With the rise of body hair transplant, it has become easier to complete a hair transplant on the head. The process is simple enough – hair is harvested from another part of the body (arms, legs, beard or even stomach) and implanted on the head. Individual hair is separated, trimmed to size and then implanted in the area that has been demarcated on the head. Here too, designing the hairline is an important step, because donor hair from the scalp is minimal and subsequent changes become quite difficult.</p>

                                <p>Since the hair has been extracted from you own body, there should not be any issues related to rejection. However, there is always the chance that the actual structure of the hair might be different. So, the hair that has been taken from your legs and utilised to restructure your head hair, might not be as soft or straight. Hair taken from the beard is considered the closest to the hair found on one’s head, which is why it is considered to be the best option. In addition, the hair from the beard is permanent, which means that once implanted on the head, you should not have any further trouble with hair loss.</p>

                                <p>Not everyone can be an ideal candidate for a body hair transplant, and this is something that only a truly experienced doctor will be able to judge. There are certain criterion that need to be kept in mind, while trying to decide whether a person is ideal for a body hair transplant process. Some of the factors that need to be considered include:</p>
								<ul type="square">
								<li>
								The actual donor area and its size
								</li>
								<li>
								The structural similarity of the hair that is being harvested in comparison to the hair on the head
								</li>
								<li>
								The length of the body hair and how much it will have to be trimmed
								</li>
								<li>
								The actual number of follicular units which can be made available

								</li>
									</ul> 
									<p>
									
									</p>
							The most important factor is the density of the hair, which has to be above 40 follicular units per square centimeter.</p>
							<p>Harvesting and utilising body hair is a whole different ball game, which is why not everyone dabbles in the same. However, at Nubello, body hair transplant is a way of life and numerous people have taken benefit of the same. Not only will the procedure be done with care and precision, but you can also be sure that there is either no scar or a really small one, which will barely be visible.
