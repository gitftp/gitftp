$services->all($account_name, $repo_slug);
```

### Get a single service attached to your repository:

```

### Create a new service:

$services->create($account_name, $repo_slug, 'POST', array(
    'URL' => 'http://example.com/bb-hook'
));
```

```php
$services->update($account_name, $repo_slug, 1, array(
    'URL' => 'https://example.com/bb-hook'
