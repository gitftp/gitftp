                                <p>Follicular unit extraction is one of the most advanced techniques used to successfully harvest hair and transplant the same, for a natural look. While in the predecessor technique, which is follicular unit transplant, utilises the strip removal method, FUE works by extracting individual follicular units. In FUT, when an entire strip of hair is removed, there is bound to be a scar, even though an experienced doctor will be able to ensure that it is minimal. However, in FUE, the scarring is minimal, because the punch holes created disappear over time or get covered when the hair settles in.</p>

                                <p>As is the case with all hair transplant procedures, the doctor will need to decide whether you are an ideal candidate for follicular unit extraction or not. It will also need to be determined whether you have sufficient hair in the donor area and whether a clear recipient area can also be demarcated. The actual process of designing your new hairline is as important as the actual transplant process, because this will decide whether your hair looks natural or not. In addition, once designed, changing the same becomes very difficult..</p>

                                <p>However, the follicular unit extraction is a much more precise and advanced process, which is why not everyone provides you with this service. It takes an experienced doctor, a team of professional supports staff and a range of high precision equipment, to complete an FUE procedure. Special needles are required to punch the holes, through which the follicular units are harvested. Each follicular unit could have one to four hair and these need to be then stored carefully. Normally, the follicular units are stored in a physiological solution, which ensures that the hair does not dry out and become unusable. However, the creation of the perfect physiological is an exact science and not all people are able to do the same.</p>

                                <p>Once the grafts have been gained, the doctor needs to check them all under a microscope ensuring that each and every one of them is viable. Then comes the crucial step of preparing the recipient area and ensuring that each graft is placed with care and precision. An experienced doctor will know exactly how to align the hair with the direction of the natural hair, as this is crucial for you to have normal and natural looking hair, post procedure.</p>
